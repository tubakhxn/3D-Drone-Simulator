## Why this file exists
Use this sheet as a quick reference when publishing the simulator to GitHub or helping collaborators get started.

## How to fork and sync the project
1. Sign in to GitHub and open the main repository page you want to extend.
2. Click **Fork** and choose your account to create a copy under your profile.
3. Clone your fork locally:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/3D-Drone-Simulator.git
   cd 3D-Drone-Simulator
   ```
4. Point an upstream remote to the original project so you can pull updates later:
   ```powershell
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<original-owner>/3D-Drone-Simulator.git
   ```
5. To stay current, regularly fetch upstream changes and merge them into your fork:
   ```powershell
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   git push origin main
   ```

## How to run the simulator locally
1. Open PowerShell and move into the project folder:
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\Tuba Khan\Downloads\3D Drone"
   ```
2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install all dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch the simulator entry point:
   ```powershell
   python -m src.drone_sim
   ```
5. Press `Esc` or close a render window to exit when you are finished testing.

## Before uploading to GitHub
- Run the simulator once to ensure nothing is broken.
- Remove large temporary files (cache, recordings, etc.).
- Commit with a clear message describing what changed.
- Push to your fork and open a pull request pointing back to the original repository when ready.
